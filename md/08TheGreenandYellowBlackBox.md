# The Green-and-Yellow Black Box: Mobilization on Platforms for the Attempted Coup on January 8, 2023 

### Aline Roes Dalmolin[^f08_1]and Maria Eduarda Mathias[^f08_2] 

## Introduction 



This chapter aims to analyze how the mobilization for the
anti-democratic act of January 8, 2023 took place through extreme-right
Bolsonarist groups on social media platforms. The purpose is to
illustrate how the groups were organized and their gradual
radicalization. To understand the radicalization of Brazilian
extreme-right groups on social media, which led some of their members to
pose a threat to Brazilian democracy, it is necessary to link the
invasion of the Planalto in Brasilia with a history of escalating
hatred, disinformation, and lack of accountability during Jair
Bolsonaro's government (2019-2022) -- and even before that.

Radicalization has been a recurring theme for Bolsonaro and his
followers long before his election as President of Brazil in 2018.
During the presidential elections of 2018, Bolsonaro's speeches
consistently incorporated elements of military authoritarianism and
nationalism using phrases such as \'let\'s eliminate the
petralhada\'[^f08_3] and \'our flag will never be red\'[^f08_4], which garnered
significant resonance and was widely adopted among his followers.
Throughout his government, there were constant attacks on various
sectors of society and state institutions, such as the Supreme Federal
Court (STF), which repeatedly acted to hold the government accountable
for its mistakes with grave consequences for the population. For
example, the Bolsonaro government\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic
was marked by widely disseminated disinformation, often by the former
president himself, his family members, and members of his government. In
addition, delays in vaccine procurement, advocacy for unproven
medications, and the absence of large-scale vaccination campaigns and
few public education efforts by the national government.

During Bolsonaro's four-year mandate, disinformation networks were
strengthened and intensified during the 2022 electoral campaign that led
to the terrorist acts on January 8, 2023. While polls indicated Luiz
Inácio Lula da Silva as the favorite candidate in the race,
then-President Bolsonaro made several statements on social media casting
doubt on the reliability of electronic voting machines. However, this
claim was made public by Bolsonaro during an official meeting with
foreign ambassadors on July 18, 2022, in which he criticized the
Brazilian electoral system without presenting evidence for his
allegations. This meeting played a pivotal role as the Superior
Electoral Court of the country would later condemn Bolsonaro for abuse
of political power and the misuse of the media for electoral purposes
while still in office. As a result, he has lost his political powers and
was declared ineligible until 2030, preventing him from running for the
next presidential election in 2026.[^f08_5]

Attempts to undermine democracy, however, are not exclusive to Brazil. A
similar movement occurred two years earlier in the United States, led by
then-President Donald Trump. During the tumultuous 2020 US presidential
elections, characterized by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump fueled public debate
byquestioning the integrity of the American electoral system, amplified
through disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories across various
social media platforms. On January 6, 2021, Trump supporters stormed the
United States Capitol in Washington D.C. alleging election fraud, an
episode marked by vandalism, aggression, and homicide.[^f08_6] The attack
was an attempted coup which was promoted and organized online, with acts
of violence and various offline repercussions.[^f08_7]

Similarly, the attempted coup in Brazil was not a spontaneous protest
but an organized act of terrorism. It was orchestrated over the past few
years through speeches, videos, and organized mobilizations disseminated
within Bolsonaro-supporting groups that culminated on the events of
January 8, 2023, with over one thousand individuals detained in
Brasília. Masked by patriotism, the purpose of these groups has
authoritarian tendencies and aims to destabilize democracy,
demonstrating, above all, how social media and messaging app platforms
have become a disinformation machine for the far-right in Brazil.

## Platformization and Far- Right Media Ecology 

The interdisciplinary nature of the platformization of society makes it
difficult to conceptualize concretely, mainly because it refers to an
unfinished process. Technologies and everything surrounding them are
part of a multidimensional system. Since the present times are
multidimensional, Van Dijck, Poell and De Wall emphasize the importance
of contexts and how our research and observation are subject to many
structural and historical interpretations and intersections.[^f08_8]
Platforms permeate society in all its dimensions, from geopolitics to
global infrastructures, and everything is interdependent on them. For
instance, technological elements in the anatomy of a platform help guide
user interactions and actions, and thus provide an overview of how
society is shaped by them.

According to Van Dijck, Poell and De Wall, a platform is a digital
architecture that seeks to organize interactions among its users through
systematic data collection, algorithmic processing, and data
monetization.[^f08_9] The collective network of platforms constitutes a
*platform ecosystem* defined by various mechanisms. Therefore, to
understand platformization entails more than addressing techniques and
tools -- it involves recognizing a process that encompasses the
production, recognition, and circulation of meanings within an
ecosystem. Despite the undeniable benefits of the digital age, the
limitations stemming from users\' lack of understanding of the entirety
of the process become evident when they simply register to participate
in a platform. For instance, when we accept cookies[^f08_10] or terms of use
on a webpage or app, we provide our personal data and geographical
location and enter into a system whose operations we are unaware of.
Consequently, the price to pay for living inside platforms is to expose
ourselves to the black box of informational tracking and surveillance
capitalism.[^f08_11]

The term \'black box', a metaphor borrowed from the recording device
found in airplanes, trains, and cars, refers to a system with an unknown
operation, where it is possible to observe its inputs and outputs but
not how it processes data and information. According to Pasquale, we are
currently being tracked more intensively by companies and governments
and we have no idea about how this information is processed and its
consequences.[^f08_12] Following Zuboff, surveillance capitalism is an
economic structure built around the expropriation of information through
digital platforms operating through unprecedented asymmetries concerning
the interplay of knowledge and power, by extracting monetary value from
user-generated information production.[^f08_13]

To fade, dissolve, blind, or unravel -- any synonym we use does not
convey the full extent of the obscurity in a platform's operational
logics. Even though much attention is given to algorithmic performance
and its influence on users, little is questioned about the consequences
of operative patterns established by humans, or about who benefits from
the secrecy or sale of personal data from an entire society.

> But when every move we make is subject to inspection by entities whose
> procedures and personnel are exempt from even remotely similar
> treatment, the promise of democracy and free markets rings hollow.[^f08_14]

In this regard, we touch upon the essential pillar of the context which
we have chosen to unfold here. Politics, according to Castells, is
driven by emotion, passion, and hope.[^f08_15] But the Brazilian political
landscape in recent years has pushed these aspects to a limit that
challenges the fundamental principles of democracy, surpassing the
classical conception of politics as \'the competition or dialogue
between groups or proposals. Instead, politics enters a realm of
narrative conflicts whose purpose is to overshadow one another at any
cost. The way in which the coordinated action across different platforms
enabled the mobilization of an anti-democratic event of such magnitude
highlights the exercise of power of platforms in shaping the political
course of Brazil.

In recent years, Brazil has been suffering from the rampant circulation
of disinformation from dubious information sources that generate
monetizable content and stand out as communication channels for the
general population, and has occupied the space formerly dominated by
journalism and social institutions in a general sense.[^f08_16] In a context
conducive to the circulation of untruths, information manipulation has
escalated to the extent of causing chaos, instilling doubts, and
inducing moral panic. To understand the functioning of these
\'synapses\' leading to the Bolsonarist mobilizations on January 8,
2023, we will examine the ensemble of platforms activated for this
purpose, as they constitute part of a complex multimedia ecosystem.

In Brazil, a far-right media ecology has been referred by some authors
as the *Bolsonarist mediasphere*.[^f08_17] Based on Rocha, the Bolsonarist
mediasphere aims to produce false information and construct polarizing
narratives (good versus evil, left versus right, etc.), seeking to
create a parallel reality within information bubbles and promote the
unity of political activism.[^f08_18] Similar to the far-right in other
parts of the world, this mediasphere also exploits content campaigns and
digital micro-targeting.[^f08_19] The very organization of the events on
January 8 attests to the existence and organized action of networks
structured over the past few years, and without which the mobilization
for the event would not have been possible.[^f08_20]

Telegram and WhatsApp groups were the preferred spaces for radical
Bolsonarists to mobilize for the terrorist acts. However, a wide range
of information types and modes of use were activated through these
networks. Among the platforms mobilized by the Bolsonarist mediasphere,
we have chosen Telegram for this study because of its importance for
Bolsonarist groups, and its role in maintaining so-called information
bubbles favoring intense political polarization. In a survey about
internet usage behavior conducted by *Datafolha*, it was shown that
WhatsApp has a usage rate of 92% across all social strata and regions of
the country.[^f08_21] The same survey identified Telegram as the main
concern in the context of the 2022 elections given its significant user
base among Bolsonarist supporters.[^f08_22] Another reason for choosing
Telegram is how the extreme-right uses Telegram in the Global South. In
this context, we refer to Cruz and Harindranath's terminology
\'technologies of life', which encompass the experience of technologies
that mediate all aspects of social life, such as Telegram and
WhatsApp.[^f08_23]

Going beyond the concept of \'social network',' technologies of life'
blend aspects of public and private life into a semi-public, multimodal
communication.[^f08_24] \'Technologies of life' combine mass-oriented
features such as the creation of information-sharing groups and channels
with more private characteristics like encrypted conversations and the
lack of transparency in APIs for external users. This concept safeguards
usage that goes beyond what is commonly understood as a form of
mediation developed initially in social networks, which were originally
designed to facilitate bilateral message exchange between users.[^f08_25]
Thus, platforms like Telegram enable the micro-targeting of messages to
individual users while also allowing for the distribution of mass
content to large groups, facilitating the mobilization of users for
political engagement. Another reason Bolsonarists choose this platform
is that Telegram groups allow an unlimited number of users to be added,
which facilitates the organization of mobilization.

## Opening the green-and-yellow black box 

The text describes the timeline of narratives over the course of a week
on a Bolsonarist group on Telegram platform. The analysis period begins
on the day of Luís Inácio Lula da Silva\'s inauguration as President of
Brazil, January 1, and concludes on the day of the coup attempt, January
8, 2023.The first week of January 2023 witnessed significant activity
within Bolsonarist Telegram groups. The circulation of messages in these
groups included a wide array of information typologies, including texts,
videos, photographs, audio recordings, and more. Many of these contents
or even groups are no longer accessible due to actions taken by the
Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF), the country\'s highest court,
which ordered the suspension of various coup-related groups in the
post-election period in late 2022.

In this section, we will examine a Bolsonarist Telegram group,[^f08_26]
which at the time of data collection was named \'Sucessos anos 1980\'
('1980s Greatest Hits'). Lately, this group was renamed to \'Fora Lula,
Fora Desgoverno ('Out Lula, Out Disgovernment')\', which coincides with
the writing in October 2023.[^f08_27] This is a public group accessible
through an invitation link. The group remains active with 858 members
and has only one sentence in the group description: \'FORBIDDEN to send
porn content and PIX\',[^f08_28] that shows its moderators' concern in
controlling the type of content and preventing financial transactions in
the group. There is a constant forwarding of messages from other
Telegram groups and channels or of content generated in other platforms
such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.
Additionally, there is a prolific exchange of various materials such as
videos, audios, texts, links, images, and stickers.

During the first week of January, slogans like \'selva\' ('jungle')[^f08_29]
and legal terms such as \'Garantia de Lei e Ordem\' ('guarantee of law
and order')[^f08_30] and \'Intervenção Militar\' ('military intervention')
are examples of how group members were mobilized for the uprising.
However, aware of algorithm-subverting strategies used in fighting
disinformation by authorities, users adopted alternatives formats and
codes for circulating messages to call members to the January 8 event.
These messages were conveyed through photographs of handwritten notes on
sheets of paper to dodge text-based tracking algorithms. The wide
circulation of Intensive invitations to join bus caravans to Brasília
from various states of Brazil, was especially intensive in the three
days leading up to the atempted coup.

An analysis of the messages exchanged by group members in the first week
of 2023, leading up to the terrorist event on January 8^th^, reveals an
escalation of emotions among the participants, ranging from disbelief
and outrage at the political situation to expressions of extreme
enthusiasm and hope for the possibility of reversing the context,
believing in the imminent coup attempt.

Another important aspect is how personal testimonies expressed users\'
feelings about the context at that moment in first-person narratives in
texts, videos, and audios that provide their perception of the
surrounding environment. In these narratives, spatio-temporal references
are frequently used to underline the authenticity of what is being
conveyed, and to demonstrate to other members their position of
discontent with the situation as well as their active role within the
process. Particularly notable in this category are the videos and images
themselves.

> I fought all this time in \[front of\] the barracks because I believed
> they were going to do something. But now, I don\'t believe in Bolsonaro,
> not even if he himself calls me back to the streets.\
> -- User 1, January 1, 2023 [^f08_31]

User 1's message refers to the mobilizations in front of Army barracks
held by Bolsonarist groups for two months between the election results
on October 30^th^, 2022 and the attempted coup on January 8, 2023.
Several participants expressed their discontent because the
mobilizations in front of the barracks did not achieve their desired
goal of convincing the military to act in favor of a \'military
intervention\' that supposedly would prevent the inauguration of Lula as
the newly elected President on January 1, 2023.

Some narratives deny the reality of Lula\'s newly elected government.
The prevailing information in this bias was that a parallel government,
led by General Augusto Heleno, former Chief of the Institutional
Security Office of the Presidency during Jair Bolsonaro\'s government,
had been established. Among the groups, there was the alleged evidence
that he was governing the country because his signature appeared in
dismissal notices published in the *Diário Oficial da União* (Federal
Official Gazette), as mentioned by User 2 in his comment (Figure 1):

![](media/image1.jpeg)
Figure 1: User 2 sustains that General Heleno has assumed the
provisory Brazilian government.[^f08_32] Source: Telegram, 2 January,
2023.

> Well, what a barbarity. General Heleno is the overseer, and along with
> the armed forces, they will run Brazil within the boundaries. Let\'s
> stay strong in front of the barracks.\
> -- User 3, January 2, 2023.[^f08_33]

Continuing the thread of this same conversation, one user went as far
as to clarify the nature of the Federal Official Gazette publication,
followed by a comment questioning the validity of legal actions under
the Lula government, even though the official acts in question were
signed during the final days of the Bolsonaro administration.

Guys, Heleno was dismissed; he no longer holds the position of Minister
of the Institutional Security Cabinet (GSI). This publication still has
his name because it was signed before his dismissal and was published
today. Let\'s stop deluding ourselves. The new GSI minister was
appointed yesterday by \'nine\'[^f08_34] \[allusion to Lula\], and it\'s
MARCO EDSON GONÇALVES DIAS, one of the decrees signed by the
\'LULA-THIEF\' yesterday. I\'ll leave here the list of appointees.\
-- User 4, January 2, 2023.[^f08_35]

The PT issues decrees without publishing them in the Federal Official
Gazette, which has no validity. They desperately want power, even the
inauguration was fake.\
-- User 3, January 2, 2023.[^f08_36]

I notice this in the 14 Telegram groups I participate in as a
conservative patriot and contributor to the dissemination of videos,
audios, and written comments. Starting in the early hours of January 2,
2023, there is a significant increase in the average number of opinions.
Most of them post banners saying \'GENERAL STRIKE ON THE 9TH\' IN
BRAZIL, and others invite to urgently form a large gathering of
Brazilians in Brasília. They clarify that they do not desire a left-wing
government, which they see as a THREAT to Freedom and democracy.\
-- User 2, January 3, 2023.[^f08_37]

Between January 4 and 6, messages of convocation for the activities
circulated intensively, including detailed information about caravans
with links to city-specific groups organizing caravans to Brasília. In
many messages, the use of the word \'selva\' signifies the coup
mobilization taking shape, and the term \'patriota\' ('patriot')
identifies the supporters of the cause, following an already established
naming convention in Bolsonarist groups.

Patriots of God\... For those who cannot go to Brasília, fill the QGs
(military headquarters). But Brasília has to be huge. Many, many are
already heading there. Believe, Bolsonaro had already posted the map on
his Instagram a month ago, indicating Brasília as the center of the
protest. Jungle, jungle. SOS Armed Forces. We don\'t want Lula in power.
A general cleanup of institutions. Brasília must be surrounded, with
coordinated and orderly crowds. No one enters or leaves (Congress and
Supreme Court). Go, Brazil! Our flag will never be red.\
-- User 5, January 4, 2023.[^f08_38]

Calling all patriots! Folks, let\'s share this group and clarify its
true purpose. It\'s a call to patriots who want a new September 7^th^,
just as Professor Olavo de Carvalho talks about in his videos. We will
come out in the largest mass of people Brazil has ever seen. The left,
which thinks it\'s the majority, will fall to the ground humiliated
because God is the one who governs Brazil and our lives. Communism has
no place\... Order and progress now.\
-- User 6, January 4, 2023.[^f08_39]

For those who need a bus to Brasília, just contact us on WhatsApp at
\[hidden number\]. Ramiro Caminhoneiro is providing 3,000 buses.
Everyone, join Ramiro dos Camioneiros\' \[sic\] live on Instagram now.
There are 3,000 buses to take people to Brasília for free. Share
URGENTLY!!! It\'s a critical call, or it will be the slavery and misery
of all.\
-- User 2, January 5, 2023[^f08_40]

Good evening, everyone. We are recruiting individuals who have
availability to travel to Brasília by bus, departing on Sunday and
returning on Thursday. Everything is paid for, and you will be camping
in the Planalto area. Please help us spread the word and find more
people. We currently have 5 buses, and if we have more participants, we
can secure additional buses. Interested individuals can contact Carla at
\[hidden number\].\
-- User 7, January 6, 2023.[^f08_41]

It is worth noting that the organizer mentioned by User 7, Ramiro
Caminhoneiro, is one of the protest leaders arrested on January 20,
2023, by the Federal Police in a specific operation to apprehend
financiers, participants, and instigators of the coup events.[^f08_42]

Figure 2: Post explaining where the locations for the attempted coup
events would be held. The post reads: 'The party at Selma\'s house has
begun, everyone is invited, let\'s enjoy it'. In the image, you can see
the text 'Location of Selma\'s party' and 'cake table', circled in
purple. Source: Telegram, 6 January, 2023.

Another important aspect is the informative messages about the event in
Brasília, which circulated primarily between January 6 and 7, explaining
to group participants where they should position themselves on the
Esplanade of Ministries -- the central plaza with government buildings
where the riots took place. In the image above, the term \'Mesa do
Bolo\' ('cake table', referring to the table where cake is served at
birthday parties) refers to the building of the National Congress,
indicated as the \'Location of Selma\'s Party\' (Figure 2).

The term \'Festa da Selma\' ('Selma \'s party') was the code word used
to call rioters for the events in Brasilia in late December, especially
in messages circulating on open API platforms like Instagram, Facebook,
TikTok, and Twitter, and made visible by the use of the hashtag
*#festadaselma*.[^f08_43] The use of codes and encrypted messages was aimed
at not drawing the attention of security agencies, the general public,
or even the algorithms themselves,[^f08_44] as indicated in the following
post, initially shared on Instagram and later disseminated in the
Telegram group (Figure 3).

![](media/image3.jpeg){width="2.861111111111111in" height="3.6375in"}

messages for the coup events. In the posted photo, it says in
Portuguese: 'Attention!!! The algorithm doesn\'t recognize handwritten
messages. Take photos and post them! Share the information'.. Source:
Telegram, 6 January, 2023.

Finally, the posts that circulated in the group between January 7 and 8
continue to coordinate the previously mentioned aspects, emphasizing
information about the concentration of protesters and their arrival in
Brasília, as well as images of the events themselves. January 8 was the
peak in the circulation of videos and images in the group, highlighting
the festive and celebratory tone which was followed by disillusionment
in the face of the failed attempted coup movement. We also recognized
messages that attest to the presence of \'infiltrators\' who were
allegedly distorting the supposed democratic nature of the event by
promoting vandalism of public property.

The events concluded on January 8 with the declaration of a federal
intervention in the public security department of the Federal District
(Brasilia's administrative region), that led to the removal of its
governor, Ibaneis Rocha, and the police detention of 300 individuals in
the act. On the same day, all Bolsonarist encampments near the army's
general headquarters and other military units in and around Brasilia
were dismantled.[^f08_45]

As of the completion of writing this text in October 2023, the work of
the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) on the attempted coup
events in the National Congress is now in its final stages. Ongoing
investigations continue by the Federal Public Ministry (state
prosecutors) and the Federal Police. So far, thousands of individuals
who participated in the attack have been issued prison warrants, with
2,151 of them arrested on the spot during acts of vandalism.[^f08_46] The
Supreme Federal Court (STF) has been dedicated to the trial of the
financiers of the attacks, having sentenced six of them with 12 to 17
years prison terms..[^f08_47] The alleged omission of the Institutional
Security Office (GSI) (the Brazilian government's intelligence unit, an
agency directly subordinate to the President's Office) , is also under
investigation, with new names being added to the ongoing investigations.
Among those recently indicted is the name of the former president, Jair
Messias Bolsonaro.

## Conclusion

The intensification of social media usage and the spread of false
information created a scenario in which platforms and the far-right
media ecology played a crucial role in the events leading to the
terrorist attacks during the attempted coup of January 8, 2023. This
goes beyond the mere use of platforms as it involves a complex interplay
between technology, social actors, and information ecosystems that
fundamentally shape modern society. Understanding platformization goes
beyond the technical features of these platforms and implies recognizing
their substantial impact on establishing alternative realities,
constructing extremist rhetoric, and disseminating it at alarming rates.

The extensive use of platforms in mobilizing Bolsonarists for the
attempted coup not only raises a debate over media regulation in Brazil,
but also implies a discussion on how the circulation of content in the
Bolsonarist mediasphere intensifies the platform\'s anti-democratic
potential.

At the end of the proposed framework, we can raise several questions
that touch on profound themes such as: the operation of networks and
algorithms; the foundation of social mobilizations and public
demonstrations; the process of disinformation; the power of
communication and discursive strategies within digital communities; and
the escalation of hatred and advocacy of unconstitutional ideas. These
tensions lead us to problematize the participation of civil society in
discussions with platforms and governments.

We also note that these platforms not only transmit information and
disinformation but also fuel the atmosphere of revolt, enthusiasm, and
hope, thus reinforcing polarization beyond the election period. We can
see how these emotions catalyzed the events of January 8 with the
Bolsonarist mediasphere playing a fundamental role in organizing and
mobilizing the terrorist acts, allowing communication and coordination
among supporters of the Bolsonaro government.

Reflecting on the role of Telegram in mobilizing for the event on
January 8, 2023 in Brazil contributes to an understanding of how
platforms shape the course of global politics and democracy today, even
though we cannot yet fully grasp the dynamics of the Bolsonarist
mediasphere due to its integration into platform logic and surveillance
capitalism. This brings to light the obscurity of the platformization
ecosystem in which we are immersed because, as users, we are not allowed
to comprehend all of its logics and operational dynamics. Who operates
behind the mechanisms of the networks, and what are their intentions
beyond monetization? Are we experiencing increased access to freedom, or
is our security diminishing? These are open questions that raise future
developments.
